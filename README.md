# Voice App	
CS50x Final Project by jecampos and CSjianbel

# Description

This is a collaboration for CS50's Introduction to Computer Sciece Final Project

We have made a Voice application with a GUI made using python's pygame module, It has the basic features such as recording, playback and saving.  

The main showcase of our project is we have implemented a visualization of the sound waves of the audio being received by your microphone.

When it comes to the colors of the lines in the visualization, they provide no real information and are just there for aesthetic.

We believe that we have been able to apply our learnings from the course through this project. We hope you enjoy our Voice App

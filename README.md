# Final Project
 CS50x FInal Project by jecampos and CSjianbel

# Description

So for the Final Project, we decided that we would create a voice app that would be able to take the input of 
microphone and visualize it. We also added basic features that a lot voice applications have, such as recording,
playback, and a save feature. So the way the application works, is that you speak into your mic as soon as you loaded the application and 
would see the lines move in accordance with what you said. With the buttons aboves the visualization, you can use the record button to
start recording. Once you feel like you're done recording, you would click the stop button and have the option to either play back the audio, or save it somewhere on the desktop
using their buttons respectively. When it comes to the colors of the lines in the visualization, they provide no real information and
are just there for aesthetic. I hope you enjoy this small project.

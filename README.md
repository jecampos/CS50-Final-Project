# Final Project
 CS50 FInal Project by jecampos and CSjianbel

# Description

So for the Final Project, we decided that we would create a voice app that would be able to take the input of 
microphone and visualize it. We also added basic functions that a lot voice applications have, such as recording,
playback, and a save feature. So the way the application works, is that you would click the record button whenever u wanted to 
start recording. Once you're done, you would click the stop button and have the option to either playback the audio, or save it
using their buttons respectively. When it comes to the colors of the lines in the visualization, the provide no real information and
are just there for aesthetic. I hope you enjoy this small project.

# Voice App	
CS50x Final Project by jecampos and CSjianbel

# Description

This is a collaboration for CS50's Introduction to Computer Sciece Final Project

We have made a Voice application with a GUI made using python's pygame module, It has the basic features such as recording, playback and saving.  

The main showcase of our project is we have implemented a visualization of the sound waves of the audio being received by your microphone. 

We believe that we have been able to apply our learnings from the course through this project. We hope you enjoy our Voice App
